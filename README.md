# LeakyPlumbingRepair

This was my first project and it was a doozy, learned right then and there that procastinating is not an option for coding projects. Coding while your tired also DOES NOT work!!! The goal of this program is to create an invoice based on what time of day it is, how many hours was put in etc. The only flaw I had was that when the program compares two times such as 2:30pm - 5pm you end up with the wrong answer... Of course I know how to fix it but this is more for archival purposes anyways.
